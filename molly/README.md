# Bespoke Ethos — Alex/Molly Custom AI Tutor Case Study (V3 - Narrative Focus)

A single-page, static HTML/CSS testimonial showcase, now significantly enhanced with creative visual styles and scripts to provide a compelling, narrative-driven walkthrough of Alex's story.

## Overview

This version is focused on delivering a highly engaging user experience. The design has been updated to be more dramatic, emphasizing the story flow with subtle animations and visual cues.

**Key Visual Enhancements:**
*   **Narrative Flow Animations**: Sections now fade in and slide up as the user scrolls, creating a visual "walk-through" of the story.
*   **Dramatic Styling**: Bolder fonts, more pronounced orange accents, and subtle glow effects on key elements (Hero headline, CTA buttons).
*   **Process Visuals**: The "How It Works" section includes a pulsating ring animation on the step numbers to draw attention to the low time investment.
*   **Staggered Reveals**: Elements like the Molly features and "What This Demonstrates" points appear sequentially to guide the reader's eye.

## Features

✅ **Highly Stylized Narrative**: Creative use of CSS/JS to enhance storytelling.  
✅ **Scroll-Triggered Animations**: Smoothly reveals content as the user scrolls.  
✅ **Authentic Narrative**: Still contains all the specific, human details (Ore Dock Brewing, learning disabilities).  
✅ **Fully Static**: Single HTML file with embedded CSS/JS for easy deployment.  
✅ **Responsive**: Mobile-first design.

## File Structure

```
bespoke-ethos-testimonial/
├── index.html          # Main page (all-in-one, highly stylized)
├── assets/
│   └── logo.png        # Bespoke Ethos logo (placeholder for hero-profile-view.png)
├── README.md           # This file
```

## Assets

*   **Logo**: `assets/logo.png` (Used in navigation and footer).
*   **Hero Image**: The current `index.html` uses the logo as a placeholder for the intended `hero-profile-view.png`. **You must replace `assets/logo.png` with the actual `hero-profile-view.png` file in the `assets` folder for the hero section to display correctly.**

## Customization

All styles and scripts are embedded within the `index.html` file. To customize, you will edit the `<style>` and `<script>` tags directly.

## Deployment

This is a single, static HTML file. Deploy to any static hosting service (Manus platform, Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, etc.) by uploading the `index.html` file and the `assets` folder.

**Note**: This version is a creative interpretation of the "wildest and walking through the story" request. It provides a much more dynamic and visually engaging experience.
