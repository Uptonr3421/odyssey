# 🤖 Autonomous Build System - Complete Guide

**Status**: ✅ ACTIVE & READY
**Deployment**: November 1, 2025
**Purpose**: Zero-friction automated monitoring and procedures

---

## 🎯 What You Get

**Completely Autonomous** (runs without you):
- ✅ Monitors system every 6 hours automatically
- ✅ Posts alerts ONLY if problems detected
- ✅ Generates weekly summary (Friday 3pm)
- ✅ Checks post-deployment health automatically
- ✅ Persists state between sessions (MCP Memory)

**Zero Manual Procedures**:
- ✅ No daily "ask me" reminders
- ✅ No manual checklists
- ✅ No button clicking
- ✅ No friction

**Intelligent Alerts**:
- ✅ Only notify on actual issues
- ✅ Context-aware (knows deployment status)
- ✅ Prevents alert fatigue
- ✅ Trends and history tracking

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Layer 1: Autonomous Monitoring (GitHub Actions)

**Runs automatically every 6 hours:**
```
.github/workflows/autonomous-monitor.yml
├─ Checks Sentry for critical errors
├─ Checks Dynatrace for performance issues
├─ Checks Supabase for data integrity
├─ Evaluates combined health
└─ Creates issue ONLY if problems found
```

**Result**: You only get notifications when something needs attention

---

### Layer 2: Post-Deployment Checklist (GitHub Actions)

**Runs automatically after each deployment:**
```
.github/workflows/post-deploy-check.yml
├─ Waits 5 minutes for metrics
├─ Checks post-deployment health
├─ Creates monitoring checklist
├─ Notifies about deployment
└─ Stays open until verified
```

**Result**: Structured monitoring after every deploy

---

### Layer 3: Weekly Summary (GitHub Actions)

**Runs every Friday 3pm:**
```
.github/workflows/weekly-summary.yml
├─ Aggregates Sentry data
├─ Aggregates Dynatrace data
├─ Aggregates Supabase data
├─ Tracks trends
└─ Creates weekly report with recommendations
```

**Result**: High-level overview every Friday

---

### Layer 4: Claude Auto-Startup Check

**Runs when you open Claude:**
```
.claude/auto-startup-check.md
├─ Checks if >24h since last full check
├─ Queries MCPs (Sentry, Dynatrace, Supabase)
├─ Reads MCP Memory for state
├─ Shows relevant alerts
└─ Continues without nagging
```

**Result**: You always know current status without asking

---

### Layer 5: State Tracking (MCP Memory)

**Persists between sessions:**
```
.claude/memory-config.md
├─ Tracks last check times
├─ Stores active alerts
├─ Remembers deployment status
├─ Calculates trends
└─ Manages alert acknowledgment
```

**Result**: System knows what's already been checked

## 🎯 How It Works Day-to-Day

### Scenario 1: Normal Day (Everything Fine)

```
9am: GitHub Action runs monitoring
     → All systems green
     → No issue created

You: (Open Claude)
Claude: "✅ System check 3h ago - all good"

You: (Work normally)
Claude: (No interruptions, monitoring in background)

3pm: GitHub Action monitors again
     → Still all good
     → No alerts
```

---

### Scenario 2: Performance Issue Detected

```
9am: GitHub Action runs
     → Dynatrace: Load time 3.4s (baseline 2.1s)
     → Creates GitHub issue: "⚠️ Performance Alert"
     → Issue labeled 'alert', 'monitoring'

You: (See notification)
     Click issue → See Dynatrace data

You: (Open Claude)
Claude: "⚠️ Alert: Performance degraded (+1.3s)
         Hero image not optimized. Want details?"

You: "Show me what's happening"
Claude: (Provides Dynatrace analysis, suggests fixes)

You: (Fix issue, deploy new version)

Next 6h check:
     → Performance back to normal
     → Issue auto-closes or you close it
```

---

### Scenario 3: Just Deployed

```
1pm: You merge PR to main
     Vercel auto-deploys

1:05pm: GitHub Action detects deployment
        → Waits 5min for metrics
        → Checks post-deployment health
        → Creates checklist issue

You: (See notification with checklist)

Next 6h check:
     → Monitors intensively
     → All green, deployment stable

4pm: You open Claude
Claude: "🚀 Post-deployment check (3h in)
         No errors, performance stable
         1 user sessions active
         Monitoring continues"
```

---

### Scenario 4: Weekly Summary

```
Friday 3pm: GitHub Action runs
            → Generates weekly report
            → Email/Slack notification (if configured)

You: (Check email or see issue)

Summary shows:
- Avg performance: 2.1s (↓0.3s from last week) ✅
- Error rate: 0.3% (↓0.2%) ✅
- Deployments: 4 (100% successful) ✅
- New errors: 12 (8 resolved) ✅
- Recommendations: 3 items
```

---

## 🚀 Activation Checklist

**Before this system works:**

- [ ] GitHub Secrets configured (Sentry, Dynatrace, Supabase keys)
- [ ] Workflow files exist (`.github/workflows/*.yml`)
- [ ] Claude has MCP integrations (Sentry, Dynatrace, Supabase)
- [ ] MCP Memory enabled
- [ ] First monitoring run in 6h (will create issues if test data available)

---

## 📞 Troubleshooting

### Issue: No alerts created

**Solution**:
1. Check GitHub Secrets are configured
2. Verify workflow files exist
3. Check Actions tab → see if workflows ran
4. Manual trigger: Click "Run workflow" button

### Issue: False alerts

**Solution**:
1. Adjust thresholds in workflow files
2. Configure alert levels
3. Example: Change error threshold from 5% to 10%

### Issue: Claude not running auto-checks

**Solution**:
1. Verify MCP Memory is enabled
2. Check .claude/auto-startup-check.md exists
3. Tell Claude: "Run auto-startup check"
4. It will initialize memory
